- All of the needed packages from the textbook are available to you here.  Note that the `View` function will not work on DataCamp as it does in RStudio, but I have added interactive versions of many of the data frames below and this simulates the `View` function well.

- Please use this as a playground to answer the Learning Checks throughout the [ModernDive](http://moderndive.com) textbook.  There are no problems to complete here, but please do play around as needed!

- Remember to use the `library` function to load any needed package given at the top of the chapters of the [ModernDive](http://moderndive.com) textbook.

- Pressing the **Submit Answer** button will run all of the code in **script.R** in your **R Console**.  If you'd like to test things out, feel free to use the **R Console** directly.
