title       : Supplement to ModernDive textbook
description : To supplement learning of the material covered at http://moderndive.com, this chapter provides a playground for you to work with the code and better understand what each of the gray chunks of R code throughout the book does.

- All of the needed packages and derived data sets from the [textbook](http://moderndive.com) are available to you here.  Note that the `View` function will not work on DataCamp as it does in RStudio, but I have added interactive versions of many of the data frames below and this simulates the `View` function well.

- Please use this as a playground to answer the Learning Checks throughout the [ModernDive](http://moderndive.com) textbook.  There are no problems to complete here, but please do play around as needed!

- Remember to use the `library` function to load any needed package given at the top of the chapters of the [ModernDive](http://moderndive.com) textbook.

- Pressing the **Submit Answer** button will run all of the code in **script.R** in your **R Console**.  If you'd like to test things out, feel free to use the **R Console** directly.
